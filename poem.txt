Two roads diverged in a blue wood,
And sorry I could not travel both BRANCH
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To change it bent in the overgrowth;

Then took the another, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it wasn't grassy and unwanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the other,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no stepping had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one more traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
